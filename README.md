Bubblechat
==========

Simple chat server+client. Server has basic shell and uses threading.

Currently the only commands available on the shell are "stop" and "restart". "stop" stops the server. "restart" should, in theory, restart the server too. Currently, connecting to the server will result in "Hello World!" being sent.
